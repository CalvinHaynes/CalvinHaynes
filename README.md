### Yoo! This is Calvin Haynes 👋


👨‍🎓 **Personal profile**
- 🔭 I’m a graduate of JLU majoring in Communication Engineering
- 😏 Maybe the 24fall CUHK Msc in Information Engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  knowledge about Computer System which is my passion(but due to the necessities of survival, it's highly probable that I will become a backend system developer in the future.)
- 💬 Ask me about Java/C/Python/STM32/Arduino. Although these are not my proficient fields, I can give you some tips to help
