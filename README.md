## 👨‍🎓Personal introduction

- 🔭 I’m a graduate of JLU majoring in Communication Engineering
- 😏 24fall CUHK Msc in Information Engineering(admitted！happy ending!）
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in Computer System
(but due to the necessities of survival, it's highly probable that I will become a backend system developer in the future.
After admitted in MscIE in CUHK, maybe I have the opportunity to pursue Phd, who knows (^ω^), life is indefinite!)
- 💬 Ask me about Java/C/Python/STM32/Arduino. Although these are not my proficient fields, I can give you some tips to help
